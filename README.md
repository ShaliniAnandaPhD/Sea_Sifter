# Sea_Sifter
Seasifter harnesses MongoDB to store open-source microplastic contamination data. Here, we combine the latest research papers on plastic removal innovations, enabling interactive mapping of accumulation hotspots with NLP-powered clean-up recommendations suited to each location's plastic density

🌊 Seasifter: A Leap Forward in Tackling Microplastics Pollution at the MongoDB hackathon yesterday 🚀

Fresh from a 12-hour hackathon, I'm excited to present Seasifter – a tool designed to visualize and analyze global microplastic pollution, now on track to become an interactive chatbot!

🔍 Seasifter's Cutting-Edge Features:
- Dynamic Mapping with Folium: Explore an interactive map showcasing microplastic accumulation across oceans and coastlines.
- Analytics: Using Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average to predict microplastic accumulation in 1,2,5,10 years
- Scientific Insights with LangChain: Seamlessly synthesize and summarize scientific research, focusing on plastic remediation methods and studies.

📊 Data-Driven Approach:
- MongoDB Database: Powers our core visualizations with extensive microplastic contamination data.
- LangChain Integration: Enhances our capability to process and understand vast amounts of scientific literature, turning complex data into actionable insights.

🌐 Future Vision: Seasifter Chatbot:
- The goal is to evolve Seasifter into an interactive chatbot, making environmental data more accessible and engaging.
- Highlighting the urgency: We've identified areas like San Domingo in the Dominican Republic, predicted to experience a surge in microplastic accumulation. This kind of targeted insight is critical for effective clean-up operations.

🖥️ Tech Stack:
- MongoDB for robust data management.
- Folium for creating intuitive, interactive maps.
- LangChain for synthesizing scientific papers and generating knowledge graphs.
